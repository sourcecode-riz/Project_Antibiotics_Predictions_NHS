# Abstract 
This study explores innovative solutions for predicting antibiotic consumption costs within the UK healthcare system using artificial intelligence and data science techniques. Employing machine learning models and conducting cross-evaluation using National Health Service (NHS) data, we aimed to enhance the accuracy of forecasting economic impacts of antibiotic prescriptions across different UK regions.

The research utilized publicly available English Prescribing data from NHS, focusing on a six-month period from November 2023 to April 2024. We applied various supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and hierarchical clustering, to analyse antibiotic consumption patterns and their economic implications.

Our findings revealed significant regional variations in medication expenditure across England, with the Midlands bearing the highest costs. Ensemble methods, particularly Random Forest and XGBoost, outperformed linear models in predicting antibiotic costs.

The application of hierarchical clustering provided further insights by revealing distinct prescription patterns, offering a foundation for more targeted interventions in antibiotic management. While the study faced limitations, including a restricted timeframe and lack of patient-specific data, it established a solid groundwork for future research in this critical area of healthcare management and antimicrobial resistance mitigation.

By providing a more accurate understanding of antibiotic consumption patterns and their economic impact, this research enables healthcare systems to better manage resources and implement targeted interventions, moving towards more effective, evidence-based approaches for managing antibiotic use.
